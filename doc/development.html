<h1>Development for Bos Wars</h1>
<hr>

This file should give you some information to help with development of
the project.<p>

For most up to date information, it is highly recommended to check the
information on the Bos Wars <a href="https://boswars.org">website</a>,
including the page on <a href="https://boswars.org/development.shtml">development</a>.<p>


<h2>IRC - Internet Relay Chat</h2>

You can try to meet other Bos Wars developers and users on the
<a href="https://libera.chat/">Libera.chat</a> IRC Network, in the
<a href="irc://irc.libera.chat/boswars">#boswars</a> channel.

<h2>Mailing list</h2>

If you want to help with development, you should 
<a href="http://archives.seul.org/bos/dev/">join</a> 
the bos-dev mailing list.

<h2>Bugs and tasks</h2>

You can find <a
href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=stratagus-bos">known bugs</a>
 on the <a
href="http://boswars.org">project pages

Before starting work on a bug or task, please ask on the mailing list or in the 
IRC channel whether anybody else is already working on it.

<h2>Building Bos Wars</h2>

<h3>Installing the Git client</h3>

If you want to help develop, you should use Git. 
The online <a href="https://git-scm.com/doc">Git documentation</a> will
help you master Git.

<h3>Getting Bos Wars from Git</h3>

The <a href="https://codeberg.org/boswars">Bos Wars project</a> has the following main repositories:

<ul>
    <li>boswars - The Bos Wars source code<p>
	The source code for the whole game including the engine.
    The source is licenced under the GNU General Public License.
	<b>This contains the sources needed for development.</b>

    <li>website.bos - The Bos Wars Website<p>
	The website is stored in git for easy updating and version management
	by multiple people.  This module is not needed unless you plan to update
	the website.

    <li>materials.bos - Bos Wars assets<p>
	Sources of large or difficult to generate Boswars assets like graphics
    and sounds.

</ul>


<h3>Getting Bos Wars without Git</h3>

Only releases are made outside of Git.  If you wish to be involved with
development, you should obtain the sources via Git.
Git usually remains quite stable and is easier
for you to keep up to date. Release versions of Bos Wars are available 
<a href="http://www.boswars.org/download.shtml">here</a>.

<h3>Building Bos Wars</h3>

You can find instructions for compiling Bos Wars at 
<a href="install.html">install.html</a>.<br>
Since you already have a copy of the source, you may skip 
ahead to step 2.

<h2>Source code documentation</h2>

The engine has tagged source documentation.<p>

You need either <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">DoxyGen</a> or 
<a href="http://docpp.sourceforge.net/">DOC++</a> 
to generate source code documentation.

<h3>Tags used in source code</h3>

We use the doc++ tags:<p>

Multi line source code documentation:<p>
/** ... */<p>

Single line source code documentation:<p>
/// ... <p>

Start grouping:<p>
//@{ or /*@{*/<p>

End grouping:<p>
//@} or /*@}*/<p>


<ul>
    <li>@name
    <br>Name of file or group.
    <li>@param
    <br>Describes function/macro parameter
    <li>@return
    <br>Describes function return
    <li>@see
    <br>Links to other section
</ul><p>

Please read the doxygen/doc++ documentation.

<h2>Sending a patch</h2>

Once you have completed some work, you will probably want it to be 
included in the main Bos Wars source.<p>

You can create a pull request on the
<a href="https://codeberg.org/boswars/boswars">Bos Wars Codeberg project page</a>.
<p>

Alternatively, you can create a patch with these steps:<p>
<ul>
    <li>git diff &gt; your-nickname.diff
    <li>upload 'your-nickname.diff' to the 
    <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?group=stratagus-bos">patch tracker</a>.
</ul>
